# **Maternal haemorrhage** includes both postpartum haemorrhage (defined as blood loss ≥500 ml for vaginal delivery and ≥1000 ml for caesarean delivery) and antepartum haemorrhage (defined as vaginal bleeding from any cause at or beyond 20 weeks of gestation).  
# 
# **Maternal sepsis** is defined as a temperature <36°C or >38°C and clinical signs of shock (systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg and tachycardia >120 bpm). **Other maternal infections** are defined as any maternal infections excluding HIV, STI, or not related to pregnancy. 
# 
# **Maternal hypertensive disorders** include gestational hypertension (onset after 20 weeks gestation), pre-eclampsia, severe preeclampsia, and eclampsia, but exclude chronic hypertension (onset prior to pregnancy or prior to 20 weeks gestation) unless superimposed preeclampsia or eclampsia develop.
# 
# **Maternal obstructed labour and uterine rupture** aggregates obstructed labour (arrest in the first or second stage of active labour despite sufficient contractions), uterine rupture (non-surgical breakdown of uterine wall), and fistula (an abnormal opening between the vagina and the bladder or rectum following childbirth). 
# 
# **Abortion** is defined as elective or medically indicated termination of pregnancy at any gestational age. **Miscarriage** is defined as spontaneous loss of pregnancy before 24 weeks of gestation with complications requiring medical care.
# 
# **Ectopic pregnancy** is defined as pregnancy occurring outside of the uterus.
# 
# **Indirect maternal deaths** are due to existing diseases that are exacerbated by pregnancy. Examples include maternal infections and parasitic diseases complicating pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium, and diabetes in pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium. 
# 
# **Late maternal deaths** are deaths that occur six weeks to one year after the end of pregnancy, excluding incidental deaths.
# 
# **Maternal deaths aggravated by HIV/AIDS** are deaths occurring in HIV-positive women whose pregnancy has exacerbated their HIV/AIDS, leading to death.
# 
# **Other direct maternal disorders** encompasses a wide range of maternal disorders that do not map to other diseases in the GBD cause list, including other fatal or non-fatal complications occurring during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period.
