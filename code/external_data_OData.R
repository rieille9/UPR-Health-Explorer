•	Health rights are explicitly reserved for citizens or restrictions permitted means the constitution explicitly reserves health rights for citizens or permits restrictions on the right to health for non-citizens.  For example, the constitution may state that foreign citizens enjoy all rights except those reserved for citizens and separately state that citizens enjoy the right to health.    
•	No specific provision means that the constitution does not explicitly mention the right to health. This does not mean that the constitution denies this right, but that it does not explicitly include it.
•	Right guaranteed using citizenship language means that the constitution protects the right to health in authoritative language, but uses the word “citizen” instead of “person” to guarantee the right.  For example, constitutions in this category might guarantee that citizens have the right to health.  This language may be interpreted to exclude non-citizens from the right to health. 
•	Guaranteed right, not specific for non-citizens means that the constitution guarantees the work rights to “everyone”, but does not specifically protect non-citizens’ right to health. 
•	Guaranteed for non-citizens means that the constitution guarantees the right to health for foreign citizens in authoritative language.  For example, constitutions in this category might guarantee free medical care regardless of citizenship or guarantee that foreign citizens enjoy the same rights as citizens, including the right to health.",

•	No specific provision means that the constitution does not explicitly mention the right to equality or non-discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity for all citizens. This does not mean that the constitution denies this right, but that it does not explicitly include it.
•	Equality guaranteed, not specific to SOGI means the right to equality and/or non-discrimination is guaranteed for all citizens, but not specifically on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.
•	Aspirational for SOGI means that the constitution protects the general right to equality and/or non-discrimination based on sexual orientation and/or gender identity but does not use language strong enough to be considered a guarantee. For example, constitutions in this category might state that the country aims to protect or promote equality based on sexual orientation.
•	Guaranteed for sexual orientation only means that the constitution protects the right to equality and/or non-discrimination based on sexual orientation in authoritative language, but does not explicitly mention gender identity. For example, constitutions in this category might guarantee citizens’ right to equality based on sexual orientation or make it the State’s responsibility to ensure this right.
•	Guaranteed for sexual orientation and gender identity means that the constitution protects the right to equality and/or non-discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in authoritative language. No country guarantees equality across gender identity, but not sexual orientation.

•	Marriage is defined as between a man and a woman means that the constitution explicitly defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman.
•	Constitution does not address same-sex marriage means that the constitution does not explicitly address the right of same sex couples to marry. The constitution may guarantee the right of men and women to marry and found a family, but it does not use exclusionary or inclusive language to address the right for same-sex couples. 
•	Not explicit, but right to marry is ungendered means that the guarantees the right to marry to “everyone” using ungendered language.
•	Explicitly guaranteed means that the constitution explicitly states that individuals can marry a person of their same sex.",

•	The term ‘disability’ includes both general references to disabilities and specific mentions of mental or physical disabilities.
•	No specific provision means that the constitution does not explicitly mention the right to equality or non-discrimination for persons with disabilities. This does not mean that the constitution denies this right, but that it does not explicitly include it. 
•	Equality guaranteed, not specific to persons with disabilities means that while the constitution broadly guarantees the right to equality and/or non-discrimination, but it does not specifically do so regardless of disability.
•	Aspirational provision means that the constitution protects the general right to equality and/or non-discrimination for persons with disabilities but does not use language strong enough to be considered a guarantee.

The right to medical services captures references to the state’s commitment to cure, restore or rehabilitate health; to ensure adequate health facilities for the population; or to provide access to healthcare services, curative services, medical aid, medical assistance or treatment to persons with disabilities.
•	The term ‘disability’ includes both general references to disabilities and specific mentions of mental or physical disabilities.
•	No specific provision means that the constitution does not explicitly protect the right to health for persons with disabilities. This does not mean that the constitution denies this right, but that it does not explicitly include it for persons with disabilities or all persons.
•	Right guaranteed, not disability-specific means that the constitution broadly guarantees the right to health or the right to medical services, but does not specifically guarantee any of these rights to persons with disabilities or broadly protect persons with disabilities from discrimination.
•	Aspirational provision means that the constitution protects the right to health or medical services for persons with disabilities but does not use language strong enough to be considered a guarantee. For example, the country endeavors to provide the right to health for persons with disabilities or intends to provide medical services broadly and persons with disabilities enjoy equal rights.
•	Health rights generally guaranteed and disability discrimination prohibited means that the constitution broadly guarantees the right to health or to medical services and also provides general protection against discrimination based on disability, but does not guarantee any approach to health specifically for persons with disabilities.

•	Aspirational or subject to progressive realization means that the constitution protects the right to health, public health or medical care but does not use language strong enough to be considered a guarantee, or states that these rights will be implemented progressively or within a certain time period.

•	Aspirational or subject to progressive realization means that the constitution protects the right to public health but does not use language strong enough to be considered a guarantee, or states that these rights will be implemented progressively or within a certain time period.

•	Some aspects guaranteed means that the constitutional explicitly guarantees aspects of the right to public health, such as access to immunization, but only mentions 1 or 2 areas and does not mention them within the context of protection of public health or disease prevention.
•	Guaranteed right means that the constitution explicitly guarantees the right to public health to citizens in authoritative language. Constitutions in this category either broadly guarantee the protection of public health or disease prevention, or enumerate 3 or more areas of health protection that typically constitute public health.  For example, constitutions in this category might guarantee citizens’ right to preventive health care or make it the State’s responsibility to ensure the protection of population health and prevention of disease.",
